## ganrer

This is an example folder used in the **MergeFiles.py** script. It can take any name, you need only change the name of the `input_folder` in the script. The folder must contain at least 2 files pertaining to the same WhatsApp chat, with no gaps in the history. The merged file will be placed in the **input** folder with the same name as this folder, but as a .txt file.

## input

This folder contains any files you want to input into the **ChatToCSV.py** script. The script can only take a single input at a time, and creates two output files into the **output** folder. Both will retain the original file name, but with the .csv extension instead, and one will append '\_no\_stopwords' to the end.

## output

This folder contains .csv files which are outputted from the **ChatToCSV.py** script.
