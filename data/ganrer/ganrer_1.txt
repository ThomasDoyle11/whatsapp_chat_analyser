28/07/2014, 21:24 - Joe Swanson 😤: Did you have any knowledge of it prior?
28/07/2014, 21:24 - Ganrer: I thought he might be a tygarian
28/07/2014, 21:24 - Ganrer: But that was a guess when it talked about his eyes
28/07/2014, 21:24 - Joe Swanson 😤: Same when he talks about the eyes 'almost looking indigo'
28/07/2014, 21:24 - Joe Swanson 😤: Yes!

28/07/2014, 21:26 - Joe Swanson 😤: Has he been taken in a brothel?
28/07/2014, 21:26 - Ganrer: But he didn't say which queen
